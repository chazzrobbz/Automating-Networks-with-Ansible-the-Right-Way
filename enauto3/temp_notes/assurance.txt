notes:
  - like intersight
  - gain full visibility
  - predict performance
  - rapidly troubleshoot
  - can see overall summary from GUI

  - network health: infra components (wired/wlan)
  - breaks down into router, core, distro, access (wired)
  - breaks down into WLC and APs (wireless)
  - client health too
  - can click on individual issues (clients impacted, etc)

data > information > insight > action (increasing biz benefit)

intersection of human, business, technology -> design thinking

self-healing network

can check user-level stats using "Cisco 360"
  - global health
  - 360 is a low-level view (most detailed)

for each device you have, will show health.

some devices (like apple iOS) have extra analytics that DNAC accesses

PI: device based mgmt, no intent/business
DNAC: superset of PI (still has SWIM, etc)

path trace:
  - not traceroute
  - uses topology info
  - queries devices for ECMP

integrates with appdynamics to measure application health
