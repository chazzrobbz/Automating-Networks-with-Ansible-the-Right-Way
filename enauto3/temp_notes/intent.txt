basics:
  - northbound API to provide "business intent" API to apps
  - focus on outcomes rather than individual steps
  - RESTful CRUD over HTTP with JSON payloads
  - hierarchical "domains" and "subdomains"
  - retrieve auth token to identify privileges of each REST client

know your network:
  sites:
    - CRUD on sites, assign devices to sites
    - sites are hierarchical collections of other sites and "buildings"
  topology:
    - network health for layers 1-3 (including VLANs)
  devices:
    - device info based on timestamp, MAC, UUID, name, etc
  clients:
    - Get client details and health info
  users:
    - Get user info by specifying user-ID or MAC address
  issues:
    - Get detailed info and recommended mitigation for an issue
    - can supply issue-ID or MAC address
