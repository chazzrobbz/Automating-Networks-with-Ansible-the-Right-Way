gui:
  - click on "Command runner" tool on front dashboard
  - only executes read commands
  - will say "command not supported" if you do a config command
  - build your device list manually or by searching
  - then, create command list by adding command strings
  - will run commands on all devices (can remove some from specific devices)
  - green box means success, can click to see output (can save)
  - red box means failure, probably command string typo
  - can click red box to see error output, just like the shell

api:
  - need to perform a GET network-device to get UUID
  - then, POST commands to run on a given UUID
