basics:
  - considered "eastbound"
  - can push event notifications to third party apps
  - follows subscriber/publisher design, like dial-in telemetry
  - user provides a receiving URL (webhook/callback URL)
  - DNAC sends notifications as HTTP POST requests to the callback URL


NEW WAY 1.3.1.x gui setup:
  - no longer a separate bundle, integrated for better performance
  - system settings (gear) > settings > events and subscriptions
  - list of possible events shown, click to subscribe and see tags

OLD WAY gui setup:
  - under Platform settings, manage bundles
  - enable "network events for REST API endpoint" (deprecated, not needed)
  - configure the bundle and set the REST endpoint (callback URL)
  - developer tooklit, integration flows
  - schedule to publish SWIM events, schedule flow
  - can schedule frequency
  - to choose events: platform settings, event settings
  - possible test endpoint `https://mylistener.ngrok.io`
  - username/password required, but maybe not necessary?

  - GET/POST `/dna/intent/api/v1/event/subscription`
