# Migrating from CLI-driven to Model-driven Programmability
This directory contains two subdirectories:
  * `yang_vis`: The setup files required to install and operate a variety of
    YANG exploration tools.
  * `netconf`: The Python scripts and supporting files needed to update the
    WAN configuration using `ncclient` on the network devices.
