basics:
  - enhanced PXE by embedding scripts into the image
  - unlike pnp/ztp, does not require an image on device
  - perform device boot after timeout, or try forever
  - could be local image or static URL in "boot system" path
    - rommon BOOTMODE = ipxe-forever | ipxe-timeout | device
    - rommon IPXE_TIMEOUT = seconds
  - DHCPOFFER contains TFTP/FTP/HTTP server with image
  - only works via management port (gig0/0)
  - manual boot (not often used) requires "boot manual switch" to boot
  - to identify the device at the DHCP server:
    - chassis serial number (option 61)
    - product ID (option 6)
    - device MAC address
  - DHCPv4 and v6 both use option 77 user-class set to "iPXE"
  - the device tries DHCPv6 first, then DHCPv4 after
  - can interrupt with serial break to console

ipv6:
  - regular RS/RA process to obtain SLAAC address
  - client sends DHCPv6 solicit to DHCPv6 server
  - DHCPv6 advertise from server contains boot file URL
  - does it work with stateless DHCP? it should, device can use SLAAC/LLA

sample_commands:
  - boot ipxe forever (switch 2)
  - boot ipxe timeout 30 (switch 2)
  - boot system ... (only matters in device boot or ipxe timeout)
  - no boot ipxe
  - troubleshoot in rommon using net6-show, net-dhcp, net6-dhcp
  - use "dig" to resolve names
