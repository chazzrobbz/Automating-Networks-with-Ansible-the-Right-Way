components:
  agent:
    - embedded in cisco products
    - usesopen pnp over HTTP
    - tries to acquire pnp server via DNS, DHCP, etc
  server:
    - centralized logic for managing images/configs
    - DNAC services this purpose, formerly APIC-EM
  protocol:
    - runs between agent and server
    - ?
  helper app:
    - runs on iOS/android to serve as a tether for pnp
    - downloads image over cellular/wifi
    - transfers to device using special cable
  connect:
    - cloud component for server discovery
    - useful when DHCP and DNS aren't in use
    - device contacts devicehelper.cisco.com to get IP of pnp server
    - have to register your org with cisco to use this option

deployments:
  branch:
    - netadmin provisions device in pnp application
    - onsite installer uses helper app on smartphone to onboard device
    - device reaches pnp server to get it's full config/image
  campus:
    - configure DHCP server with option 43 to carry DNAC IP/hostname
    - netadmin provisions device in pnp application
    - installer cables device and powers it up
    - device reaches pnp server to get it's full config/image
  connect:
    - netadmin configures controller profile in pnp connect
    - web portal lets you assign device templates to devices
    - register DNAC with Smart Account so pnp connect knows how to broker
    - installer cables device and powers it up
    - device queries pnp connect, discovers pnp server (DNAC)
    - device identifies itself by sn and downloads full config/image
  unplanned:
    - deploy sites without pre-configured them in pnp server
    - configure DHCP server with option 43 to carry DNAC IP/hostname
    - installer cables device and powers it up
    - device reaches pnp server but is marked as unplanned
    - can be claimed/configured later, but this tests the connectivity
